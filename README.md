# Lost and Found App
## Find.it: San Francisco's Premier Lost and Found Resource

Find.it is a simple app that allows users to create a profile and post an 'ad' for a lost or found item. Each post maps the location of the lost / found item on a Google maps interface.

## Technologies Used

Ruby, Rails, Postgres, JQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, AJAX

## User Stories

Users create a profile to create a post to advertise a lost or found item. If you've lost an item, you can view the post and connect with the person who posted the item via email. If you've found an item, you can post information about the item and help return it to its owner.

I wouldn't deploy this app into production without implementing some type of email cloaking. That is outside the scope of this assignment.
